History
-------

This small project is an earlier attempt.  If you want the svn log look at
the private svn repo

    svn+ssh://marmaduke.gi.alaska.edu/home/svn/repos/ice/UAF-misc/betterhydro

(Of course you'll need permissions.  Or just write an email to Ed.  I tried
svn2git but it did not work for me.)
