The codes and data in this subdirectory do the runs which appeared in
Ed's not very impressive talk at IGS 2012.  To use, two actions are
needed.

1) Download or link the SeaRISE Antarctic data set
[ALBMAPv1 at SeaRISE site](http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/images/4/4d/Antarctica_5km_dev1.0.nc)

2) Link the code netcdf.m which is up one level in the directory:
  $ ln -s ../netcdf.m

Then run in Matlab/Octave:

  >> antlakes
