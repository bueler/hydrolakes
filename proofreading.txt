Dear Katharina Ruckert --

Thanks for the careful copy-editing.  I have some general comments first,
followed by specifics line-by-line.  The attached scanned PDF may help locate
the corrections, because I have used green pen to show where they are.

I apologize that I have had to correct several of my own technical errors.

General Comments
----------------

There were some changes you have made, presumably to match journal defaults,
that should be changed back because they change the meaning of the text.

* The word "equation", or its abbreviation "Eq.", actually *means* something,
  namely a mathematical relation where two quantities are equal.  Thus "Eq."
  should not be added at every LaTeX command \eqref{...}.  In particular,
  (4), (17), (20), and (33) are actually *inequalities*, and exactly not
  equations!  It is fine to say "inequalities (4)" or "bounds (4)".  I have
  indicated below where this needs correction.

* Similarly, (32) is a "model" or "coupled equations" or just "Eqs.", but not
  "Eq.".  I have indicated below where this needs correction.

* In some places, replacing "zero" by "0" obstructs readability.  I have
  indicated places where I think "zero" is readable.
