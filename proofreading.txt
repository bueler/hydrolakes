Dear Katharina Ruckert --

Thanks for the careful copy-editing.  I have some general comments below,
followed by specifics line-by-line or indicating the CE or TS number.  Of course
the page and line numbers refer to the version
"gmd-2014-113-typeset_manuscript-version5.pdf".

The attached scanned PDF may help locate the corrections.  I have used green
pen to show where they are.

I apologize that I have had to correct several of my own technical errors.  I
(I have indicated those that are my fault.)

Best Regards,

Ed


General Comments
----------------

There were some changes you have made, presumably to match journal defaults,
that should be changed back because they change the meaning of the text.

* The word "equation", or its abbreviation "Eq.", actually *means* something,
  namely a mathematical relation where two quantities are *equal*.  Thus "Eq."
  should not be added at every LaTeX command \eqref{...}.
  
  In particular, (4), (17), (20), and (33) are actually *inequalities*, and
  not at all equations!  It is fine to say "inequalities (4)" or "bounds (4)"
  or "constraints (4)".  I have indicated below where this needs correction.

  (These changes do not appear on the copy_editing_changes PDF, but instead
  apparently came from different copernicus.cls settings or something.  In any
  case, the appearance I intended is in my PDF file upload on 22 April, and in
  the .tex file uploaded 23 April.)

* Similarly, (32) is a "model" or "coupled equations" or just "Eqs.", but not
  "Eq.".  I have indicated below where this needs correction.

* In some places, replacing "zero" by "0" obstructs readability.  I have
  indicated places where I think "zero" is appropriate.

* The second author, who is Dutch, notes:  "One tiny detail about the references
  to "van der Wel" and "van Pelt".  In proper Dutch the "v" in "van" needs to be
  capitalized when not preceded by a first name or letter.  This will only affect
  the citations and not the manuscript authors on the first page."


Line-by-line Comments
---------------------

* page 1, first address line:  Please remove the second "Alaska", to leave the
  simpler form "University of Alaska Fairbanks, USA".  (my fault)

* page 1, lines 6,7,9 of abstract:  Please replace "(1)" with "1." and so on,
  or a numbering system of your choice.  I do not want this enumerate to be
  confused with equation numbers.  (my fault)

* page 2, first column, line 10 from bottom:  Please replace "namely, partial
  differential equation" with "namely as a partial differential equation".  (my fault)

* page 2, second column, line 15 from top:  Please remove "also".  (my fault)

* page 3, first column, line 3 of first paragraph:  Please break the sentence.
  Specifically, replace "2012) and the" with "2012).  The".  (my fault)

* page 4, second column, line 3 from bottom:  Please replace "fills pore spaces"
  with "fills the pore spaces".  (my fault)

* page 5, first column:

  - line 12 from top:  Remove "Bueler and Brown, 2009;" here.
    The citation 7 lines later is correct.  (my fault)

  - lines 25 and 26 from top:  Replace "Eq. (17)" by "inequalities (17)",
    in both cases.

  - line 2 from bottom:  Replace "the logarithm of N_{til} and e"
    by "e and the logarithm of N_{til}".  (my fault)

* page 5, second column:

  - line 19 from top:  Replace "water.  In fact" with "water
    in the till.  In fact".  (my fault)

  - line 24 from top:  Replace "bounds of Eq. (17)" with
    "bounds (17)".

* page 7, second column:

  - line 3 from top:  Please replace "is part" with "is already
    part".  (my fault)

  - line 3 from top:  Please replace "0" with "zero".

  - line 6 from top:  Remove "; see", which changes the
    meaning.  I do mean "pressure Eq. (2.12)" or "pressure equation (2.12)".

* page 8, first column:

  - line 5 from top:  Replace "constraints Eg. (4)" with
    "constraints (4)".

  - line 12 from top:  Replace "constraints (Eq. 4)" with
    "constraints (4)".

  - line 4 from bottom:  Replace "Equation (32) is" with
    "Equations (32) are".

  - line 3 from bottom:  Replace "Mohr-Coulomb (Eq. 18)" by "Mohr-Coulomb Eq. (18)".
    Replace "pressure (Eqs. 23 and 24)" by "pressure Eqs. (23) and (24)".

* page 8, second column:

  - line 6 from top:  Replace "constraints Eq. (33)" by "constraints (33)".

  - line 11 from top:  Replace "inequalities Eq. (33)" by "inequalities (33)".

  - line 17 from top:  Replace "have m" by "has m".  (my fault)

  - line 3 from bottom:  Replace "0" by "zero" in both instances.

* page 9, first column:

  - line 6 from top:  Replace "Model Eq. (32) is a parabolic version of Eq. (34)"
    by "Model (32) is a parabolic version of model (34)".

  - line 9 from top:   Replace "Eq. (32)" by "Eqs. (32)".
  
  - line 17 from top:  Replace "Eq. (32)" by "Eqs. (32)".

  - line 23 from top:  Replace "Eq. (32)" by "Eqs. (32)".

* page 9, second column, first line:  Please replace "model Eq. (32)" by
  "model Eqs. (32)".

* page 10, first column:

  - line 13 from top:  Replace "The equations in model Eq. (32)" by "Equations (32)".

  - line 16 from top:  Replace "equation in Eq. (32)" with "equation in model (32)".

  (See below for CE1.)

  (See below for CE2.)

* page 12, first column, line 9 from bottom:  Replace "the equations of Eq. (32)" by
  "Eqs. (32)".

* page 12, second column:

  - line 20 from top:  This is a phrase from an earlier
    version of the paper which should be removed.  Replace all of this: "though
    the proof above ... stability.  Nonetheless" by simply "and".  (my fault)

  - line 2 from bottom:  Replace "for" with "only for the diffusion part of".
    (my fault)

* page 13, first column, line 1:  Replace "model Eq. (32)" by "model Eqs. (32)".

* page 13, second column:

  (See below for CE3.)

  - line 16 from top:  Replace "full set of Eq. (32)" with "full set of Eqs. (32)".

  - line 4 from bottom:  Replace "on first-order upwinding" with "on the
    first-order upwind method".

* page 14, second column:

  - line 8 from top:  Replace "upwinding" with "upwind method".

  - line 4 from bottom:  Remove comma, so "stresses, found" becomes "stresses
    found".  (my fault)

* page 15, second column Figures 6 and 7:  Please make these figures span two
  columns, as they did in the PDF version submitted 22 April.

* page 16, second column Figures 9 and 10:  Please make these figures span two
  columns, as they did in the PDF version submitted 22 April.

* page 18, first column, line 1:  Please replace "model Eq. (32)" with
  "model Eqs. (32)".

* page 19, first column, line 1:  Please italicize "a priori", as this latin
  phrase has caused the sentence to become ungrammatical as written.


Remarks from the Language Copy-Editor
-------------------------------------

CE1:  Replace "first-order ``donor cell'' upwinding" with
      "a first-order ``donor cell'' upwind method".

CE2:  The definition of "PETSc" is "Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation".

CE3:  Replace "recipe" with "algorithm".
