hydrolakes
==========

This now-completed project is about constructing good subglacial hydrology models for ice sheets and glaciers, implementing and testing them in PISM, supporting actual modeling of a tidewater glacier (Nordenskioldbreen in Svalbard) and an ice sheet (Greenland), and writing a thesis and paper about that.

This paper has been published in Geoscientific Model Development, an EGU journal:

  * E. Bueler and W. van Pelt (2015) Mass-conserving subglacial hydrology in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model version 0.6. Geoscientific Model Development 8 (6) pp. 1613â€“1635, [doi:10.5194/gmd-8-1613-2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1613-2015)


Using the model within PISM
---------------------------

The model is part of [PISM](http://www.pism-docs.org).  It first appeared in the `stable0.6` release (February 2014) and will be supported, and possibly improved, in future versions.

The main model described in the paper, which has both till and a linked cavity network, is run in PISM using the `-hydrology distributed` option; this is the `Distributed` derived class of the `Hydrology` class in the PISM source code.  The model has an understandable relationship to several other models, but it lacks conduits.

A further simplification removes the linked cavities and instead uses overburden pressure as the modeled water pressure; in PISM runs this is option `-hydrology routing`, and based on derived class `Routing`.

The model has a successful verification case.  Running the model gives reasonable results for Nordenskioldbreen, shown in Ward's thesis [van Pelt (2013)](http://wardvanpelt.com/thesis_WvanPelt.pdf).

For Greenland the results are shown in the [GMD paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1613-2015) above.  They are generated by scripts which live in the PISM source code repo, in directory `examples/std-greenland/hydro/`.


Build the PDF
-------------

To build `gmd-hydro.pdf`, which requires LaTeX and the Copernicus LaTeX class, do

    $ mkdir Copernicus
    $ cd Copernicus
    $ wget http://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/Copernicus_LaTeX_Package_v_2_7.zip
    $ unzip Copernicus_LaTeX_Package_v_2_7.zip
    $ cd ..
    $ ln -s Copernicus/copernicus.cls
    $ ln -s Copernicus/copernicus.bst
    $ make


History
-------

The current model evolved from a series of more or less flawed, but mostly serious, attempts to improve the hydrology in PISM.  Note that work started in summer 2012.

An old version is in `phoenix/` in this repo.  The simpler `-hydrology routing` model is observed to be suitable for locating subglacial lakes in the `bueler-igs2012/` subdirectory in this repo.  Another out-of-date version is in `dampnotes/` in this repo; for some of the history of our attempts to build a better model see `dampnotes/README.md`.  Until July 2013 the latest version was `subenhydro.tex`, and that was the model used in the last chapter of Ward's thesis.  Then the actual englacial part was removed and the name became `subhydro.tex`.  Then Andy changed it to `gmd-hydro.tex` in an attempt to get things going toward submission to _Geoscientific Model Development_.

An analysis of the pressure equation implicit in (Bartholomaus et al.~2011) was stripped out of the main paper in April 2014, and published in the [_Journal of Glaciology_](https://www.igsoc.org/journal/60/222/t14j075.pdf).  See subdirectory `barthextend/`.
