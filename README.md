hydrolakes
==========

This small project is about testing hydrology under ice sheets, in a mode more suitable for subglacial lakes than for ice streams or surging.

To use, download the SeaRISE Antarctic data set [ALBMAPv1 at SeaRISE site](http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/images/4/4d/Antarctica_5km_dev1.0.nc).

Then run FIXME

To build the notes, which requires LaTeX, do

    $ ln -s ~/pism/doc/ice_bib.bib
    $ make
