\subsection*{Editor's comments and instructions}  \begin{quote}
\emph{Chief Editor Jo Jacka:}

\emph{Could you please examine the reviews and address, point by point, each of the issues raised by the reviewers? You should revise the manuscript in line with the reviewers' comments, or provide me with point-by-point well-argued reasons for not revising the manuscript.}
\end{quote}

\medskip
\noindent I appreciate the quick review process!  I have examined and addressed the reviewer's comments point-by-point.  I have spent most of my effort making revisions to address these points.


\subsection*{Reviewer \#1}  \begin{itemize}
\reply{This short letter discusses the glacial hydrology model of Bartholomaus and others (2011), an extension to a distributed model, and the relation to other distributed models in the literature.  As a description of how to convert a `lumped' model to a distributed model it is a succinct account that may be instructive for many readers.  It is well written.}
{I appreciate this supportive summary.}

\reply{However, I have a slight issue with this model in the way that it is eventually described, and that is an issue of timescales.  As I understand it, the model that is finally proposed is to combine equation (9) with equation (10), the steady state reduction of equation (4).}
{No, that is not proposed.  There is no statement that steady state equation (10) should be included in a numerical model.

The only statement that could have caused this idea in the reviewer's mind is, I believe, that equation (10) is ``perhaps evidence supporting the \emph{a priori} inclusion of such a functional relationship into a model'', after which I attempted to make the relation to Flowers and Clarke who \emph{do} include such an equation, though of the wrong functional form if you believe Bartholomaus, Schoof, Hewitt, etc.  An explicit disclaimer is added regarding such an implementation idea.

Indeed the submitted manuscript says ``a two-dimensional version of equation (9) is numerically solved \dots [in PISM]'' \emph{before} equation (10) is even derived.  I have added additional flags to make sure no readers think (10) is anything other than an emergent property, in steady state, of a model that solves (9) numerically.}

\reply{\dots This makes sense if the timescale over which pressure changes is slower than the timescale over which the size of the cavities change. This may be true in some circumstances, but certainly not in all, particularly when meltwater is routed englacially from the surface and the pressure likely changes much more rapidly.  I think this needs to be pointed out very clearly, as many model applications of subglacial hydrology need to be aware of the timescales of interest and whether a model is appropriate for those. If such a discussion can be added, and the points below taken into account, I see no reason not to publish this correspondence.}
{Because Bartholomaus et al.~(2011) is all about these short timescales, I assumed any reader of the current note would not consider a steady state equation as a possible numerical model component.  Nor do I.  I was trying to point out an unnoticed relationship between Bartholomaus et al.~(2011) and Flowers and Clarke (2002), both before the flood of new literature on these shorter timescales.

In any case, I agree with the above comment.  Equation (10) for steady state is now explicitly disclaimed as a numerical modeling suggestion.  As it is rather important in connecting Bartholomaus et al.~(2011) with prior literature, equation (10) remains as a deduction from the Bartholomaus model.}

\reply{Specific comments \smallskip \\
1. Some of the discussion about the role of the pressure equation, its mathematical nature, and its implications in steady state are I think already well appreciated - at least more so than this letter seems to suggest. The addition of englacial storage in Hewitt (2013) is exactly what converts the elliptic pressure equation to a parabolic equation, and this is discussed extensively by Werder et al. (2013)---the distributed component of that model is essentially the same as described here.  Both of those models are not purely subglacial---they include englacial water in the same was as described here.}
{The reviewer is correct, and the relationship to Werder et al.~(2013) is noted.

My omission is a consequence of a rapidly-changing literature, I think.  In particular, the 2D numerical implementation of equation (9) appeared in the completely-open PISM code base on 5 February 2013, \emph{before} the submission of Werder et al.~(2013).\footnote{For example, see commit \texttt{https://github.com/pism/pism/commit/e6dae9619fb11f3e2b347f82a9f837ea2b93a12a}.  My point is that my claim can be verified, not that there is any reason anyone would be reading PISM code commits!}

We built a numerical model based on the distributed extension Bartholomaus et al.~(2011) before seeing any of the cited 2013 papers.  This is simply, and not surprisingly, simultaneous discovery of the englacial extension of the Schoof et al.~(2012) and Hewitt et al.~(2012) work.  Furthermore we achieve a benefit of the englacial-storage parabolic pressure equation which is explicitly discounted as ``prohibitively expensive'' in Werder et al.~(2013), namely that one can enforce bounds on the pressure; see Bueler and van Pelt, submitted.}

\reply{2. There are many factors of W missing (glacier width) such that the equations as written are not dimensionally consistent. In particular, when substituting for $S_{sub}$ from (5) to (6) a factor of $W$ to go with $f L/h$ is missing, and all subsequent ratios $f /h$ should read $f W/h$ (equations (7)--(9)).}
{FIXME}

\reply{3. $W$ is used both for glacier width and for distributed water sheet thickness - one had better be changed (I would suggest to use $h$ for water sheet thickness in line with Flowers and Clark (2002), and a different notation for the bedrock bump height).}
{FIXME}

\reply{4. The bound of $P_o$ mentioned in line 45 corresponds to the water pressure reaching flotation, but not to the emergence of water at the glacier surface, which would require $P$ to reach $(\rho_w/\rho_i) P_o$.}
{FIXME}

\reply{5. On line 48 it is stated that a two-dimensional version of equation (9) is solved in PISM.  Equation (9) is not a closed equation, so it should be clarified here what is actually solved  together with equation (9).  Presumably some sort of Darcy-like flux relationship relating $Q$ to  $A c$ and $\nabla P$, but also a relationship between $P$ and $A_c$ (which it should be stressed is a variable in (9)).  If it is equation (10) rather than equation (4) that is used, this is quite different from the system solved by Schoof and others (2012).}
{FIXME}

\reply{6. The steady state relationship of equation (10) between pressure and cavity size may be unstated in Bartholomaus and others (2011), but this concept is well known in glacial hydrology, and formed the basis of Schoof [2010]’s argument for distinguishing cavity-like and channel-like drainage elements. Whilst the fact it is an increasing relationship is the same as for the power law relationship of Flowers and Clarke [2002], I fail to see how this provides justification for the same relationship in non-steady circumstances.}

\subsection*{Reviewer \#2}  \begin{itemize}
\reply{The reviewed article \dots is an excellent use of the correspondence format of Journal of Glaciology.  The letter synthesizes current hydrology models to find the most efficient and complete implementation of a variable subglacial/englacial hydrology for ice sheet/glacier modeling.  The derivation of equations and statement of assumptions is perfectly clear.  The discussion of implications resulting from the relevant equations is thorough.}
{I have made the goals of the short note clearer so as to limit its scope to deductive consequences of the Bartholomaus et al.~(2011) original, and a bit more (i.e.~distributed extension and a comment on steady state).  Note I do not want readers to think my note makes a broader claim of the ``most efficient and complete implementation.''}

\reply{I recommend that the manuscript be accepted for publication with a few minor corrections. The recommended corrections have been included in an annotated PDF of the manuscript.}
{I address these helpful points as follows:

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item[line 20] \emph{I think it would be useful to add a sentence or two between these two paragraphs explicitly stating the differing applicability of a distributed versus lumped model before moving on the the pressure equation(s).}

I understand this comment.  In the restructured form of the introductory material, as motivated by this and related reviewer comments, there is an itemized list of the three goals of the paper.  The derivation of the lumped pressure equation still comes first because it is purely-deductive (i.e.~it follows directly from the Bartholomaus et al.~(2011) equations).  FIXME

\item[line 57]  \emph{While infrequent, I’m not convinced that such geysers are rare or unusual.  Martin Truffer and collaborators tell of such over-pressurization of  englacial water leading to similar eruptions on Black Rapids glacier.   I don’t know if this has been reported in the literature.}

FIXME

\item[line 61]  \emph{This is a valuable result, but I would rather see the paragraph describing the PISM implementation of Eqn 9 here as a final statement, after the discussion of steady-state implications.}

FIXME
\end{itemize}}

\reply{Generally, I find that the letter would benefit from a clear statement about the motivation for the model comparisons and subsequent derivations.}
{I totally agree.  I have to admit that my primary motivation was \emph{mathematical}, that is, to deduce more-fully the consequences of the model equations in Bartholomaus et al.~(2011), and the paper now states this motivation directly.  A much-clearer summary of the \emph{goals} of the paper, which are easier to state than motivation, now appears as the second paragraph.  (The first paragraph is, as before, a summary of the Bartholomaus et al.~(2011) model.)  I believe these revisions address some of reviewer \#1's concerns as well.}

\reply{The final paragraph does not offer much in the way of closure. I recommend adding a brief concluding paragraph, or reordering existing paragraphs to highlight the implementation of the new hydrology model in PISM 0.6 resulting from equation 9.}
{While the new hydrology model in PISM was driven by the englacial model from Bartholomaus et al.~(2011), I do not want to either overemphasize this motivation (i.e.~there were other motivations of the PISM model).  Moreover this short note is not about PISM, so I have now limited references to PISM to a citation of the now-submitted PISM hydrology submodel paper (Bueler and van Pelt, 2014).}

\reply{This is an excellent addition to PISM and will surely result in new and interesting modeling results.}
