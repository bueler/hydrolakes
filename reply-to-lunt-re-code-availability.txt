We appreciate the clarification of editorial policies on code availability in GMD papers.  It is our error for having overlooked these rules.  The Parallel Ice Sheet Model has always had a fully open development process, with public access to the source for all versions, including universal access to the tip of the development trunk branch.

Our paper already provides the URL pism-docs.org, through which all code and documentation is available, but it is easy to add/revise according to this Editor comment, as follows.

Proposed revised title: "Mass-conserving subglacial hydrology in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model version 0.6"

Proposed revision to add a final section: "Code availability.  The source code for all versions of PISM is available through host website https://github.com/pism/pism.  Version 0.6 is downloadable by command 'git clone -b stable0.6 git://github.com/pism/pism.git pism0.6' or by download of the compressed archive https://github.com/pism/pism/archive/v0.6.1.tar.gz.  Extensive PDF and searchable browser documentation for PISM is contained both in the source code release above and online through PISM homepage http://www.pism-docs.org/.  PISM is licensed under the GNU General Public License (version 3, 29 June 2007)."

We believe that the editorial policy requirement that "The paper must be accompanied by the code, or means of accessing the code, for the purpose of peer-review" is completely satisfied by the URLs in the paragraph above.
