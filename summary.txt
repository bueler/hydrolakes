We describe and test a parallel 2D subglacial hydrology model.  Such a hydrology model describes the motion of liquid water, and its pressure, underneath ice sheets and glaciers.  Model goals include conserving the mass of water and generating an estimate of the ice basal shear stress.  This hydrology model describes the subglacier as a layer of till and linked-cavities, but it does not include conduits.
