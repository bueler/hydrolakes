One might suppose from this comment that it is never mentioned that conduits are
not in the model.  However, the draft in question (date 14 February 2015) already
includes the following four sentences, listed with line number, explicitly stating
that there are no conduits in the model:

95   Conduits are not included.

651  Two-dimensional models which include conduits \citep{Schoofmeltsupply} are
     not reductions of our model.

658  Our model has no conduit-like evolution equations at all, though the
     gradient-descent locations of characteristic curves from models using idea
     (ii) may correspond to the locations of conduits in some cases.

1118 ... our model has no "R-channel" conduit mechanism, in which
     dissipation heating of the flowing water generates wall melt-back.

The introduction and the conclusion, in particular, include statements to this
effect.  Generally good scientific articles say precisely what they do, not
what they do not do.  Our work, apparently, must follow other practices,
as follows:

We never claim, of course, that conduits are not an important process.

Rather we point out that existing models of conduits
are inadequate to the task of inclusion into a continuum theory of subglacial
hydrology in two dimensions.  For this reason, they are not included in
our model, which does not, should not, and even cannot (because of
unknown-in-advance user choices), fix a lattice/grid or even a lattice-spacing
scale in advance.

It is apparent that the nonconformity of this claim is driving editorial
overreach here.  There is a demand for a particular statement, one clearly
without consequence or real scientific content, as a condition for publication.

To proceed past this barrier, we have replaced the leading sentence on line
95, i.e. "Conduits are not included." with these two sentences:

     Channelized subglacial flow is widely-assumed to occur
     in Greenland, based on borehole and moulin evidence (Andrews et al., 2014,
     for example).  This important physical process for subglacial hydrologic
     transport is not captured by our model because conduits are not modeled.

> 2) As I see it, eq 32(b) and eq 18 (and the "cap" for W_til) ...

For clarity, what is referred to here are the equation

dW_til/dt = m/\rho_w - C_d

and the inequalities

0 <= W_til <= W_til^max

> ... could be included with the ice dynamics component of PISM, and eqs 32(a,c)

But it would impact mass conservation completely.  If one only had (32b) and
the constraint this would be the old, well-tested PISM model.  In other words,
this is exactly the context which explains why the *title of the paper* starts
with the words "mass-conserving".

This seems to be a complaint that our model of till saturation is directly tied
to ice dynamics, through Mohr-Coulomb, while water in the linked-cavity network
has a no influence on ice dynamics, though the ice dynamics influences the
linked-cavity network.  This is a correct description of our model.

As we point out repeatedly, our model is an extension of the Tulaczyk et al (2000ab),
Le Brocq et al (2009), and Schoof et al (2012) work.  None of these tie the
cavity or drainage system pressure to the basal shear stress, in the first case
because the model does not have such a system.  In any case we do not know how
to tie the basal shear stress to the P and W in our model.

Of course, the Tulaczyk et al (2000ab) work underlies the actually
observation-supported connection between basal melt rates
and ice stream flow, that is, the extended theoretical and field work done on the
Siple Coast ice streams.  That work was all based on the notion that there must
ultimately be drainage of the subglacial water in excess of the capacity of the
till.  There is still no evidence that the pressure gradient in the
at-the-time-unobserved drainage network affects ice flow.  By contrast, there
is much ongoing subglacial modeling based on ideas that cannot explain ice
stream flow.  We are trying not to abandon an effective model for the majority
of subglacial-water-modulated fast flow (i.e. ice stream flow) just so we can
model the latest popular curiosity, the small effect of dynamics on the slow
warm parts of Greenland.  (Note that fast outlet flow in Greenland is remarkably
insensitive to Moulin input, especially on the scale of a one-month ice sheet
model step.)

Regarding whether (32a,c) are solved correctly, this is the first paper to
bother to verify that the coupled solution is correct in more than one
horizontal dimension, through the construction and use of an exact solution.

It is a bit hard to respond to this comment.  Three times we explicitly make the
point that we are testing the model in a one-way mode:

1032 This nontrivial example demonstrates the model at large computational scale
     using real ice sheet geometry, with one-way coupling from ice dynamics giving a
     realistic distributions of overburden pressure, ice sliding speed, and basal
     melt rate.

1080 Thus only one-way coupling was tested: a steady ice dynamics model fed its
     fields to an evolving subglacial hydrology model.

1179 The current paper only demonstrates one-way coupling, in which the PISM ice
     flow and thermodynamics model feeds basal melt rate and sliding velocities
     to the hydrology model.  Two-way coupling  will appear in future work.

The last two sentences, in particular, are not obscure as they are the last two
sentences of the conclusion.

The editor says "I insist this is briefly pointed out in section 4 or 5."
Presumably "this" is a statement that "cavity size [does not] affect basal
stress".

Making a change in section 4 makes no sense because it is about
closures to the equations for the evolution of the subglacial variables (i.e.
W_til, W, P).  The basal shear stress applied to the base of the ice is not
closely-related.

So we have tried to state what is "insisted"-upon in section 5, at the end of
subsection 5.1 as follows:

     In this model the pressure $P$ does not feed back to ice dynamics through
     changing the basal shear stress applied to the ice.  Thus modeled cavity
     size, i.e.~the thickness $W$ of the water in the linked-cavity system, also
     does not affect ice dynamics.  Instead, as clearly stated in section 4, the
     yield stress $\tau_c$ is determined by the amount $\Wtil$ of water in the
     till.  Under general conditions of significant basal melting, or surface
     input, so that $m > \rho_w C_d$, the second equation in system (32) causes
     $W_til$ to increase up to its limit $W_til^max$.  Ongoing significant melt
     then causes water to pass into the linked cavity system, at which point $W$
     generally increases according to the first equation in the system, and $P$
     evolves according to the third.  Under these conditions the term
     $\partial \Wtil/\partial t$ is zero in the first and third equations
     because $W_til$ is unchangingly at its maximum value.  In summary, water
     input is first put into the till and then "cascades" into the
     linked-cavity system.

Section 2.3 never mentions $m$ or the concept of basal melt or drainage from the
surface.

Indeed that is what we imply.

No, our model is not a good one to use to describe "a basal crack driven by the
rapid drainage of a surface meltwater lake near the margin of the Greenland Ice
Sheet", to quote the abstract of Tsai & Rice.  Must our model be designed for
this?

Yes, it is an awkward sentence.  Because numerical problems at the other
extreme are already stated, "numerical" need not be mentioned in this sentence.
We have changed to the simpler sentence:

    By contrast, local changes in subglacial pressure $P$ propagate to other
    parts of the connected hydraulic system in a damped way if $\phi_0$ is large.

We are not experts on the stress boundary condition in water-filled or
air-filled cavities.  We do, however, presume that the *shear* stress applied to
the base of the ice by the water or air in a cavity is very small.  This is
exactly the approximation also used for ice shelves, for example.  In an ice
shelf the contact area is certainly larger, and probably the water velocity is
higher, and yet the applied shear stress is still ignored.

Thus we are not surprised that Schoof treats the ice-cavity interface as shear
stress-free.

> ... and I do not know the literature well enough but

We don't know of other *models* of deformable bed cavition at all.

Why?  The contact with the till (i.e. other than the cavities) could be quite
strong because large cavities in a linked cavity system could more-effectively
drain the till which contacted the ice.  Weak till is not automatically tied to
large cavities.

In any case, we are simply pointing out in our model that:

1) till is present in observations of the bed under glaciers and ice sheets

2) sliding over bumps and till can both credibly make cavities

Are these wrong?

"Such a dependence" presumably means that the basal shear stress must be a
function of cavity size.  No, we do not have that in the model.

No it is not the case the reviewer referred to.

Note the VERY clear hypothesis that "P < P_o" in Reviewer 3's setup.  This
hypothesis is not accidental; the sentence describes a "decrease [in] input" so
that the prior P=P_o case is converted to P<P_o.

This means there is a force.  In particular, N > 0 and thus v_c(N,h) in Schoof's
model is positive.  On the other hand, v_o(h) is zero if you believe its meaning
(i.e. opening of cavities is driven by contact of the ice with the bed; without
ice/bed contact the cavities do not open).  So the cavity closes.

Reviewer 3 very clearly says "This contrasts to Schoof et al. (2012) which keeps
P = Po until W <= W_r."  Reviewer 3 thus claims that P is somehow pushed
back up to P_o in the Schoof model.  We don't think that is true, because we
are actually looking at the equations in Schoof et al. (2012), apparently.

*You* say "an infinite slab of ice of uniform thickness rested on a uniform layer
of water of pressure that exactly balanced the overburden".  That is not "P<P_o",
and clearly not the case Reviewer 3 has in mind.

There is NO mention of the lateral extent of the cavity in Reviewer 3's comment.
You have made up "infinite" and "very wide" out of whole cloth.

In *your* setup our equations (and Schoof's too) say that
there is no closure of the cavity.  In *your* setup with the explicit "pressure
that exactly balanced the overburden" assumption, then N=0 and the closure term
is zero.  Our formula for opening also gives zero because of "(W_r - Y)_+" is
zero, assuming in your setup that the water is thicker than the
roughness scale (i.e. W = Y > W_r so W_r - Y < 0).  So both (13) and (14) give
zero and thus dY/dt = dW/dt = 0.

In *your* corner case, necessarily assuming no boundary conditions on the system
so as to make sens of your case, our equations and Schoof's equations don't
close the cavity.

This is a significant change of subject.  These papers assume a thin film of
water.  We agree in this case that the film had better not be thicker than
the clast size because then the old Walder argument applies and the film is
unstable.  But these models still don't tie the closure rate to the roughness
scale, to my knowledge.

What is the point here?

We agree.  Where did we "discount" these concerns?  Where did we say that our
version of the Tulaczyk C_d mechanism was the "only possible one"?

We *do* point out something that seems not to concern the editor.  A more
complicated till model is one of many, many ways to add more
totally-unconstrained-by-the-available-data parameters.  We prefer to reduce
their number not increase it.
