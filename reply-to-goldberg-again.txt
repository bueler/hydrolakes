One might suppose from this comment that it is never mentioned that conduits are
not in the model.  However, the draft in question includes the
following four sentences, listed with line number, explicitly stating that there
are no conduits in the model:

95   Conduits are not included.

651  Two-dimensional models which include conduits \citep{Schoofmeltsupply} are
     not reductions of our model.

658  Our model has no conduit-like evolution equations at all, though the
     gradient-descent locations of characteristic curves from models using idea
     (ii) may correspond to the locations of conduits in some cases.
    
1118 ... our model has no ``R-channel'' conduit mechanism, in which
     dissipation heating of the flowing water generates wall melt-back.

As there are about 500 sentences in the paper, almost 1% of the paper is already
devoted to denying that the model has conduits.  The introduction and the
conclusion, in particular, include statements to this.

We never claim, of course, that either conduits don't exist or that they
are not important.  Rather we point out that existing models of conduits
are inadequate to the task of inclusion into a continuum theory of subglacial
hydrology in two dimensions.  For this reason, they are not included in
our model, which does not, should not, and even cannot (because of
unknown-in-advance user choices), fix a lattice/grid or even a lattice-spacing
scale in advance.

It is apparent that the nonconformity of this claim is driving editorial
overreach here, with a demand for a particular statement, one clearly without
consequence or real scientific content, as a condition for publication.

To proceed past this barrier, we have replaced the leading sentence on line
95, i.e. "Conduits are not included." with these two sentences:

     Channelized subglacial flow is widely-assumed to occur
     in Greenland, based on borehole and moulin evidence (Andrews et al., 2014,
     for example).  This important physical process for subglacial hydrologic
     transport is not captured by our model because conduits are not modeled.

> 2) As I see it, eq 32(b) and eq 18 (and the "cap" for W_til) ...

For clarity, what is meant are the equation

dW_til/dt = m/\rho_w - C_d

and the inequalities

0 <= W_til <= W_til^max

But it would impact mass conservation completely.  If one only had (32b) and
the constraint this would be the old, well-tested PISM model.  In other words,
this is exactly the context for why the *title of the paper* starts with the
words "mass-conserving".

This seems to be a complaint that our model of till saturation is directly tied
to ice dynamics, through Mohr-Coulomb, while water in the linked-cavity network
has a no influence on ice dynamics, though the ice dynamics influences the
linked-cavity network.

This is correct.  As we point out repeatedly, our model is an extension of
the Tulaczyck (2000) work and the Schoof et al (2012) work.  The former
underlies the actually-observation-supported connection between basal melt rates
and ice stream flow, that is, the great theoretical and field work done on the
Siple Coast ice streams.  That work was all based on the notion that there could
ultimately be drainage of the subglacial water in excess of the capacity of the
till.  There is still no evidence that the pressure gradient in the
at-the-time-unobserved drainage network affects ice flow, though of course there
is much ongoing subglacial modeling based on ideas that cannot explain ice
stream flow.

Regarding whether (32a,c) are solved correctly, this is the first paper to
bother to verify that the coupled solution is correct in more than one
horizontal dimension, through the construction and use of an exact solution.

It is a bit hard to respond to this comment.  Three times we explicitly make the
point that we are testing the model in a one-way mode:

1032 This nontrivial example demonstrates the model at large computational scale
     using real ice sheet geometry, with one-way coupling from ice dynamics giving a
     realistic distributions of overburden pressure, ice sliding speed, and basal
     melt rate.

1080 Thus only one-way coupling was tested: a steady ice dynamics model fed its
     fields to an evolving subglacial hydrology model.

1179 The current paper only demonstrates one-way coupling, in which the PISM ice
     flow and thermodynamics model feeds basal melt rate and sliding velocities
     to the hydrology model.  Two-way coupling  will appear in future work.

The last two sentences, in particular, are not obscure.  They are the last two
sentences of the conclusion.

The editor says "I insist this is briefly pointed out in section 4 or 5."
Presumably "this" is a statement that "cavity size [does not] affect basal
stress".  (It is hard to parse the demand to find what would satisfy it.)

Making a change in section 4 makes no sense.  Section 4 is about
closures to the equations for the evolution of the subglacial variables (i.e.
W_til, W, P).  The basal shear stress applied to the base of the ice is not
closely-related.

So we have tried to state what is insisted-upon in section 5, at the end of
subsection 5.1 as follows:

     In this model the pressure $P$ does not feed back to ice dynamics through
     changing the basal shear stress applied to the ice.  Thus modeled cavity
     size, i.e.~the thickness $W$ of the water in the linked-cavity system, also
     does not affect ice dynamics.  Instead, as clearly stated in section 4, the
     yield stress $\tau_c$ is determined by the amount $\Wtil$ of water in the
     till.  Under general conditions of significant basal melting, or surface
     input, so that $m > \rho_w C_d$, the second equation in system (32) causes
     $W_til$ to increase up to its limit $W_til^max$.  Ongoing significant melt
     then causes water to pass into the linked cavity system, at which point $W$
     generally increases according to the first equation in the system, and $P$
     evolves according to the third.  Under these conditions the term
     $\partial \Wtil/\partial t$ is zero in the first and third equations
     because $W_til$ is unchangingly at its maximum value.  In summary, water
     input is first put into the till and then "cascades" into the
     linked-cavity system.

> Minor issues:

> l157: $m$ is described as being either due to basal melt or to drainage from the surface. But in 2.3 I might be wrong but I believe it is referred to as coming exclusively from basal melt -- otherwise it is implied that surface drainage goes directly into the till -- which I think is in contrast with the Tsai and Rice (2010) view of the process and others as well. Shouldn't drainage from the surface be a direct source to the hydrological system in addition to \rho_w(\partial W_{til}/\partial t - melt/rho_w)?

> l532 harder, not hardest (which sounds awkward)

> l533 confusing sentence; suggest to lead with the numerical advantage and follow up with the drawback, e.g. "By contrast, if \phi_0 is larger then the numerical solution of equation (31) is easier; but local changes in subglacial pressure P are damped and spread at the speed of influence to other parts of the connected subglacial hydrologic system."

> Finally, I make a few comments regarding other issues I saw in the reviewer-author discourse. Action is not required, so to speak, but i urge the authors to at least consider them.

> 1) Reviewer 1 commented on the odd combination of a deforming-till basal stress parameterization with a cavity opening/closure hydrologic system evolution. The author interpreted this to mean that cavitation does not occur on deformable beds, and maybe that is what was meant. But in their response the authors cited Schoof (2007). In this paper, the ice-cavity interface is treated as shear stress-free, and I do not know the literature well enough but presumably other models of deformable bed cavitation use the same treatment. I would think this would mean, as with hard-bed cavitation, that the effective coarse-grained basal stress would decrease with some measure of cavity side. Such a dependence is not present in the yield stress formulation used in this model.

> 2) Reviewer 3 is right about the "corner case" mentioned, though he might not have worded it clearly enough. In the extreme case, if an infinite slab of ice of uniform thickness rested on a uniform layer of water of pressure that exactly balanced the overburden, i don't see what would be driving the (infinitely wide) cavity to close. Replace "infinite" with "very wide" and this is the case the reviewer referred to. Furthermore, the authors say that "none of the models in the literature toe the creep closure rate to the roughness scale". Well, perhaps they do not call it "roughness scale", but this is really just semantics. Plenty of models account for the geometric arrangement of clasts and obstacles in the closure rate, for instance Creyts and Schoof (2009) and Kyrke-Smith, Katz and Fowler (2015).

> 3) As the authors point out in the manuscript and response to referees, the use of the fixed drainage term C_d is a straightforward extension of Tulaczyk et al's UPB model. It is not the only possible one, however; Van der Wel et al 2013 is cited solely as an example of one-horizontal-dimension drainage, but it is not acknowledged that their model is *another* possible extension, which takes account of vertical transport, something which this model does not do. Furthermore, I don't think anything is straightforward about this drainage term. In Tulaczyk et al 2000b (p485) it is stated that the mechanism of drainage is far from clear and while a constant parameter for drainage is assumed for simplicity, a mechanism that depends on void ratio (and by extension till interstitial water pressure via your eq 19) cannot be discounted.
